# OOP Samples

I understand the principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python language and appling the samples under [this folder](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/tree/master/OOP%20Python).
In the folder you can see the some important concepts about OOP such as abstraction, inheritance and so on.

* [Abstract Class](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/OOP%20Python/abstractClass.py): The main aspects of the principle of Abstraction.
* [Encapsulation](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/OOP%20Python/encapsulation.py):  The main aspects of the principle of Encapsulation.
* [Inheritance](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/OOP%20Python/inheritance.py):      The main aspects of the principle of InherÄ±tance.
* [Polymorphism](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/OOP%20Python/polymorphism.py):    The main aspects of the principle of Polymorphism.


# Open CV 

> OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. 
The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc.

You can reach my Open CV examples from [here](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/tree/master/OpenCV)

* [Image Processing](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/tree/master/OpenCV/OPENCV_g%C3%B6r%C3%BCnt%C3%BC_i%C5%9Fleme): The main aspects of the principle of Image Processing.
* [Object Detection](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/tree/master/OpenCV/Opencv_nesne_tespiti):  The main aspects of the principle of Object Detection
* [Object Tracking](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/OpenCV/OpenCV_nesne_takibi/Object_Tracking.py): The main aspects of the principle of Object Detection

In this section, topics such as open image, video upload, open camera, resize crop, shape text, joining images, warp perspective, blending, image treshold, blurring (smoothing), morphology operations, gradients, histogram are covered.

# Introduction To Data Science


In this section you will find some libraries that I learned in introduction to data science [here] (https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science) (Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib).


* [Numpy](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/Introduction%20o%20data%20science/Numpy.py): The main aspects of the principle of Numpy.
* [Mathplotlib](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/Introduction%20o%20data%20science/Mathplotlib.py):  The main aspects of the principle of Mathplotlib.
* [Pandas](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/blob/master/Introduction%20o%20data%20science/Pandas.py):      The main aspects of the principle of Pandas.


# Machine Learning


In this section, I will find my machine learning journey, the algorithms I have learned and the work I have done in this field.[here](https://github.com/AbdurrahimBalta/My-Python-Adventure/tree/master/Machine%20Learning)
